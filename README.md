Hello world! This is David a biostatistician and an up and coming programmer ! I am excited to contribute to the health and well being of the peoples of the world through the field of Biostatistics and quantitative research ! Thank you ! 
The issue of concern which I would like to address among young people is that of smoking which happens to be the biggest threat to the health and well being of our youth population.  That being said smoking is not a licenced pleasure for adults and older adults. in fact, smoking kills everyone young and old, causes a plethora of diseases and and increases the disease burden of a country. So a wise nation would work hard towards reducing the prevalence among it's youth population with all seriousness.
Please check out my blog for a study I did on examing the assosiation between smoking and generalized anxiety disorder among older adult males at this url: http://projectnesarcfinal.tumblr.com/
Would appreciate your comments!
